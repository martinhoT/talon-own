# talon-own

This is the set of voice commands I use with [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/), along with my [fork](https://github.com/martinhoT/talon-community-own) of the community repository.
This repository is meant to be an add-on to the community repository, and does not conflict with it.

## Requirements

- `ranger`
- My dotfiles (some configurations are assumed, e.g. aliases)

### Linux

- `i3wm`
